# vsx-tools

See and build every VS Code extension that lives next to this folder.

```sh
node vsx.js status                       # version, installed version, git state
node vsx.js pack    hover-decode         # build .vsix into dist/
node vsx.js install --all                # build everything and install into VS Code
```

An extension is any sibling folder whose `package.json` has `engines.vscode`.
Each one builds its own way: `npm run package` if it defines it, otherwise `vsce package`.
Set `VSX_ROOT` to scan a different folder.

`dist/` collects the latest `.vsix` files, handy for copying to another machine.
